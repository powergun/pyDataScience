## Teammate Matching Problem

notebook: <https://github.com/khuyentran1401/linear-programming-with-PuLP/blob/master/Matching%20problem.ipynb>

dependencies: pulp, pandas

it reminds the linear optimization problem in the puppet matching
system developed at Wt - the core concept is similar:
given some constraints and variables, can the system reach the
optimal outcome?
