> K-Means Clustering is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm.
> In contrast to traditional supervised machine learning algorithms,
> K-Means attempts to classify data without having first been trained
> with labeled data. Once the algorithm has been run and the groups are
> defined, any new data can be easily assigned to the most relevant group.
